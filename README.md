Database Design
That’s a great project! Here are the key entities and how they relate to each other:

### **Entities & Important Fields**
1. **Users** (Hosts & Guests)  
   - `id`: Unique identifier  
   - `name`: Full name  
   - `email`: Contact information  
   - `role`: Host or Guest  
   - `profile_picture`: User avatar  

   **Relationship**: A user can own multiple properties (if they’re a host) and can make multiple bookings (if they’re a guest).

2. **Properties**  
   - `id`: Unique identifier  
   - `host_id`: Owner (User) reference  
   - `title`: Property name  
   - `location`: Address or city  
   - `price_per_night`: Cost  

   **Relationship**: A property belongs to a host and can have multiple bookings.

3. **Bookings**  
   - `id`: Unique identifier  
   - `user_id`: Guest reference  
   - `property_id`: Property being booked  
   - `check_in_date`: Start date  
   - `check_out_date`: End date  

   **Relationship**: A booking is linked to a guest and a property. A property can have multiple bookings.

4. **Reviews**  
   - `id`: Unique identifier  
   - `user_id`: Guest who wrote it  
   - `property_id`: Property being reviewed  
   - `rating`: Score (e.g., 1-5 stars)  
   - `comment`: Feedback text  

   **Relationship**: A guest can leave a review for a booked property, and a property can have multiple reviews.

5. **Payments**  
   - `id`: Unique identifier  
   - `booking_id`: Linked booking  
   - `user_id`: Payer reference  
   - `amount`: Total cost  
   - `status`: Paid/Pending  

   **Relationship**: Each booking has an associated payment. A user makes a payment for their booking.

Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

API Security  

Ensuring the security of the **Airbnb clone** API is critical to protecting user data, securing transactions, and maintaining trust within the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:  

#### **1. Authentication**  
**Measure:** Users must verify their identity using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.  
**Why it’s crucial:** Prevents unauthorized access, ensuring only legitimate users interact with the platform.  

#### **2. Authorization**  
**Measure:** Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., hosts vs. guests).  
**Why it’s crucial:** Ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to, preventing unauthorized modifications or data leaks.  

#### **3. Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
**Measure:** Limits the number of requests per user/IP address within a defined timeframe using tools like API Gateway or Nginx.  
**Why it’s crucial:** Mitigates DDoS attacks and prevents abuse of system resources.  

#### **4. Data Encryption**  
**Measure:** Secure sensitive data using HTTPS/TLS protocols and encrypt user credentials, payments, and personal information.  
**Why it’s crucial:** Protects user data from interception during transmission and ensures confidentiality.  

#### **5. Secure Payments**  
**Measure:** Integrate trusted third-party payment processors with secure tokenization and PCI DSS compliance.  
**Why it’s crucial:** Prevents fraud and ensures financial transactions are processed safely.  

#### **6. Input Validation & Sanitization**  
**Measure:** Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other vulnerabilities.  
**Why it’s crucial:** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code and compromising system integrity.  

By implementing these security measures, the API remains resilient against threats, ensuring a safe environment for users to book, host, and interact securely.


CI/CD Pipeline 

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices for ensuring smooth development workflows and reliable software delivery. A **CI/CD pipeline** automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code, helping developers deliver updates efficiently and securely.  

#### **Why CI/CD is Important for This Project**  
- **Automated Testing & Reliability** – Ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality by running automated tests.  
- **Faster Deployment & Iteration** – Streamlines the release process, allowing for frequent updates and improvements.  
- **Consistency & Standardization** – Reduces manual errors and ensures deployments follow a structured, repeatable process.  
- **Improved Collaboration** – Helps developers work in teams effectively by integrating and validating code changes continuously.  

#### **Tools for CI/CD**  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates testing and deployment workflows directly within GitHub repositories.  
- **Docker** – Containerizes applications to ensure consistency across different environments.  
- **Jenkins** – A powerful open-source automation server for managing complex CI/CD workflows.  
- **GitLab CI/CD** – A built-in CI/CD solution for GitLab repositories with strong integration capabilities.  
- **AWS CodePipeline** – A cloud-native CI/CD service for scalable deployment automation.  

By implementing CI/CD, this **Airbnb clone** project can maintain a robust, efficient, and scalable development process, ensuring high-quality code and seamless feature rollouts.
